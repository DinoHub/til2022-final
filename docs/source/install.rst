Installing the SDK and Simulator
--------------------------------

.. warning::
    All the code used for this challenge is written in Python3.
    Python2 is unsupporter. Before you begin, ensure that you 
    are using Python3, and use ``python3`` or ``pip3`` instead
    of ``python`` or ``pip`` as required.


.. todo::
    Update links for repository.

Clone the ``til-final`` repository to your local machine.

.. code-block:: sh

    cd <your_workspace>
    git clone https://github.com/jehontan/til-final.git


Install the SDK and simulator.

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install ./til-final


This will install the ```tilsdk``` library and ```til-simulator```
executable on your system.

You can verify that the install is successful by executing:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip list | grep til-final
